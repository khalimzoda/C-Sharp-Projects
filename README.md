## Projects Overview

This repository contains the following individual projects:

**How to Run:**
### Option 1: Using Visual Studio (recommended)
1. Open the folder of the project you want (e.g., `C-Sharp-Projects/TicTacToe3Players`).
2. Double-click **RUNME.sln** to open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Press **F5** or click the green â–¶ Run button to start.

### Option 2: Using the .NET CLI
1. Open a terminal in the project folder (e.g., `C-Sharp-Projects/TicTacToe3Players`).
2. Run the project by pointing to its `.csproj` file:
  WindowsFormsApp5.csproj ```bash

### 1. Gomoku or 3Player TicTacTOe
**Location:** `C-Sharp-Projects/TicTacToe3Players`  
**Description:** A modified three-player Tic-Tac-Toe game played in the console. Implements game state checking and a clean user interface.
**Key Concepts:** 2D arrays, control flow, user input validation.

### 2. DotsInTheCircleCalculator
**Location:** `/DotsInTheCircleCalculator`  
**Description:** A game where the player guesses a randomly generated number within a set range. Provides hints like "too high" or "too low".
**Key Concepts:** Random number generation, loops, conditional logic.

### 3. PasswordGenerator
**Location:** `/PasswordGenerator`

This repository serves as a learning journey through C# and programming fundamentals. Through these projects, I strengthened my understanding of:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** like encapsulation and class design.
- **Algorithmic thinking** for game logic and problem-solving.
- **User Input/Output handling** in a console environment.
- **Code structure and organization** for maintainability.
